# Score Keeper
A simple score keeping web application component. The score keeper is designed to count and display two players scores, showing a winner when reached. The component implements deuce, or win by 2, scoring. This means that the game continues until one player reaches a winning score that is 2 or more greater than the opponents score.

The application/component was built using plain Vanilla Javascript, and styled using Bulma. Bulma is a free, open source frontend component framework used to build responsive web interfaces.
